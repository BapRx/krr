> I used Robusta KRR in my production clusters, and it took me less than 5 minutes to get very well detailed cpu/memory recommendations. Our applications and platform tooling were discovered automatically; our kubecontext was discovered automatically; and our kube-prometheus-stack was discovered automatically. It's just a matter of having Python and you are ready to use KRR. I'm eager to implement KRR recommendations in production, and try once again. I will come back here with more feedback.
